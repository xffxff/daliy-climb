This paper examines the biases that come along with evaluating LLMs with other LLMs and takes a closer a closer look into verbosity bias.

## Contributions or Findings (Notable to Me)
1. Summarized the bias disscussed in various papers
    - Position Bias

        Position bias occurs when, in comparing generated texts, LLMs prefer the answer given in certain positions. For example, GPT-4 tends to prefer the first option given to it, while ChatGPT prefers the second option

        To account for this bias, we can simply swap the positions and evaluate the options twice. If the model gives contradicting results between  permutations, we count it as a draw

    - Self-enhancement Bias

        LLMs tend to prefer answers generated by itself compared to answers  generated by other models. This becomes a problem when benchmarking LLMs by evaluating them with LLMs, but not so much in the context of RLAIF, as the comparisons are  always between answers generated by the same model.

    - Verbosity Bias

        Verbosity bias occurs when LLMs are influenced by verbosity, favoring longer and more verbose texts, even if they appear wordy or of lower quality.


2. GPT-4 generally prefers longer answers among those that are generated by the same LLM with the same prompt

    Method: The authors generated 100 sample answers each to 3 prompts, all from the same model and asked GPT-4 to evaluate preferences between pairs of answers via the following template

3. There is a difference in verbosity preference between GPT-4 and Humans

    The authors use the [HH-RLHF dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Anthropic/hh-rlhf), which contains human feedback data comparing pairs of answers to a prompt. Then they asked GPT-4 to evaluate the same pairs of answers and compared the results to see how often LLMs give the same judgment as humans.  

    A sample of the dataset is shown below:
